This piece was created as part of an on-going series of book arts focused on typographic explorations. This alphabet book was created to explore an idea of progression through the alphabet via the use of strings to create letter forms. For each letter one more string is added, therefore the "A" consists of one string and the "Z" is made of 26 strings. Pictured are selected spreads from the project.
