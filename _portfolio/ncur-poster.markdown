In the Spring of 2017, The University of Memphis hosted The National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR.) UofM faculty and students welcomed undergraduate students from across the country as they presented interdisciplinary research. This poster was created to promote the NCUR visual arts exhibition at the Fogelman Galleries of Contemporary Art, displaying works by intercollegiate students.
