Three self-portraits based on the artwork and styles of three different notable women artists who were influential in the history of graphic design. By creating self-portraits I hoped to establish a connection with these incredible artists who are often given less prominence in the history of art than their male counterparts.

Linoleum block print inspired by the wood block prints of Kӓthe Kollwitz. Prominent motifs drawn from the works of Kollwitz includes emphasis on dramatic lighting and the inclusion of hands.     

The next piece is influenced by illustrator Jessie Willcox Smith. Medium used to emulate Smith includes watercolor and colored pencil, and significant motifs include the reading figure positioned in front of a window.

Finally, this collaged self-portrait draws upon works created by Hannah Hӧch. Like many works by Hӧch, this piece includes an oversized head with an legs sprouting beneath.
