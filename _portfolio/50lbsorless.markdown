This book design for *50 Pounds or Less* was created as part of a larger exhibition called *What I Kept*, that examined objects kept by women immigrating to the Memphis area from their home countries. The essay for this piece was created by Dr. Susan Naomi Nordstrom. Photographs provided by the Art Museum of the University of Memphis.
