This piece was created as part of an on-going series of book arts focused on typographic explorations. *Hashtag* utilizes cut letters from magazines to recreate  the top ten most popular hashtags used on instagram. This was done to draw connections between evolving means of communication and self expression. Pictured are selected spreads from the project.
