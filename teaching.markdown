##Butts

As a design educator, I aim to guide and empower students in a manner that encourages them to work hard, take pride in the work they do, and to be open and willing to listen and learn from the people surrounding them. My method to teaching is based on emphasizing the importance of process-driven design and the benefit of following a progression of research, discovery, development, evaluation, and improvement. Also, I believe that in conjunction with a design process, a critical thinking approach to pedagogy offers students a set of skills that can apply to many aspects of life—learning to listen actively, question and investigate claims, take criticism constructively, and work to create more balanced versions of their art and themselves. I do my best to encourage students to feel comfortable taking advice and making revisions to their work, as well as to be adventurous enough to explore a multitude of different options and iterations. By teaching with a spin of critical thinking, I hope to create designers who produce work based on meaning and ethics.  

I place an emphasis on the importance of giving close attention to craft and detail, as the work they create is time-consuming and the final product should be worth taking pride in. Additionally, along with attention to detail, students must also be able to pay attention to deadlines and learn to effectively manage work time. I aspire to encourage students to learn from the world they live in, including appreciation and awareness of the artists and graphic designers that came before them and laid the groundwork for their projected profession. Thus, I work to introduce and include notable works and figures from art history into lectures and assignment objectives. Conversely, I look to the future, introducing students to evolving technologies and emerging design practices and the affects of each.

Furthermore, I endeavor to be a positive examples to my student through my drive and dedication to helping them reach their goals in their design education. Part of my world-view is that education is an opportunity that unfortunately is not available to everyone on our planet. Therefore, I want to support and influence others to recognize and have appreciation of their opportunities and work hard in everything they do for the people who do not have the same chances in life. Most importantly, I work to foster an environment that is welcoming to students of all backgrounds and walks of life—to show that everyone is welcome in higher education.
